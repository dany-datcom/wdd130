            My name is Dany Josue Jimenez Gonzalez. I am from Costa Rica and I am currently studying web development.
            I enjoy running, going to the gym, and learning new technologies. I also want to use my education to help
            my community and church by improving language learning and technology skills. One of my goals is to work
            in the technology field for a company like Amazon or Microsoft.
